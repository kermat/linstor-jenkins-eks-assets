LINBIT with contributions from AWS developed the technical guide, "Highly Available Jenkins AWS EKS Architecture", which uses Amazon's EKS And LINBIT's SDS solution LINSTOR to create a multi-AZ HA infrastructure for Jenkins to run on.

The technical guide includes infrastructure and application configuration files that can be found in this repository.
